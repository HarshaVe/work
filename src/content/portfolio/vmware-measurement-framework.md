Created a standardized experience measurement framework that transformed how VMware evaluated and improved internal tools serving 35,000+ employees.

## Situation

VMware had Corporate-wide OKRs explicitly noting "delightful and friction-free" experiences for employees. However, product and delivery teams struggled to discern actionable measures that would deliver on that promise. Decisions were based on well-intentioned but perspective-based sentiment rather than clear, accountable metrics.

Multiple teams reached out for research support, and I identified the need for a standard scorecard across VMware to measure Colleague Experience—one that would help determine where limited resources could be best utilized.

## Challenge

Create a measurement framework that would serve both executive teams needing strategic oversight and hands-on product teams needing actionable guidance.

## Approach

We followed a Design Thinking process:

- **Research** — Studied how other frameworks functioned, their limitations and advantages, and interviewed stakeholders to understand how they would utilize the information
- **Synthesis** — Chose the more arduous path of synthesizing together as a team, forcing conversations about what data points mean and how they correlate
- **Ideation** — Explored creative iterations before settling on an approachable framework leveraging known mental models
- **Pilot** — Built proof of concept across three tools representing different complexity levels:
  - **Simple** — Corporate intranet (information-focused)
  - **Complex** — CPQ tool with thousands of SKUs across global business units
  - **Oddball** — "Future of Work" office experience measurement

We ran data capture for a month, created a low-fidelity dashboard, and gathered feedback from intended audiences.

## Results

In the first three months:

- **Increased eNPS by 3%**
- **Delivered 70%+ CSAT scores** for mission-critical applications
- Empowered product teams to make meaningful, data-driven changes quickly
- Transformed vague sentiments into clear understanding of what needs attention
- Product teams now spend more time in detailed strategy debates rather than opinion-based discussions
