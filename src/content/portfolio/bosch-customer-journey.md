Designed an experiential workshop that transformed how Bosch North America's top 150 executives understood customer journey mapping—generating $1.2M in project revenue.

## Situation

At our 2016 Regional Executive Meeting, I introduced the concept of "Customer Journey." The timing coincided with a Harvard Business Review article on the topic, and mixed with urgency from Dieselgate, executives suddenly had appetite for new approaches.

But we hit a problem: the entire company glommed onto the term without understanding the concept. Many claimed intimate knowledge of customers' journeys from their internal vantage point. As one EVP told me, "I've been in this business for more than 30 years. I know the customers better than they know themselves."

Design and marketing teams had begun creating Journey Maps filled in from a Bosch perspective, missing the point entirely.

## Challenge

At the 2017 Regional Executive Meeting—three grueling days where people are desperate to leave by 4pm on day three—I needed to teach perspective. How do you get insiders to think and feel like outsiders?

## Approach

I went on stage at 4 o'clock and got massive applause when I said I wasn't there to lecture on Design Thinking. Instead: "We're going to go racing for charity."

We divided executives into teams with facilitators. Each team had 15 minutes to build a LEGO race car matching a design, then race it on one of three tracks. After the first run, they had 15 minutes to modify their cars for a final run. Fastest team wins, and we'd donate $5,000 to their charity.

Unbeknownst to participants, we divided teams into **Happy Teams** and **Sad Teams**:

**Happy Teams** got:
- Complete parts bags (checked twice)
- Clear, succinct instructions
- Engaged, knowledgeable facilitators

**Sad Teams** got:
- Parts bags missing trivial things like wheels
- Instructions in Japanese
- Facilitators who were unaware, unhelpful, or went missing

After racing, I walked through what happened. Bosch was responsible for components fitting into larger journeys—like LEGO making the bricks but having no understanding of our activity's journey. Those details impact revenue and satisfaction, and we can't understand them from internal vantage points.

## Results

- **Within one week** — Booked travel to 7 Bosch offices to take the show on the road
- **Within four weeks** — Brought in external agencies to address capacity
- **Revenue target: $900K** — Closed the year at **$1.2M**
- Work led to product development like Robinair's Connected R-1234YF ACS Machine with industry-first digital displays and over-the-air updates
