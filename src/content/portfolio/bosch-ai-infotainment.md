Led design research that proved the value of ML-driven infotainment, resulting in a development partnership between Bosch and Ford.

## Situation

Bosch Center for Artificial Intelligence had developed a Deep Learning infrastructure we believed would be a powerful enhancement for vehicle infotainment systems. However, in Bosch's funding model, Regional Business Units are responsible for finding development partners to bring technologies to market.

The team struggled to get buy-in from regional OEMs. I proposed to the CM/NA CEO and executive team that we could use design thinking to uncover compelling user scenarios that would help OEMs see the value.

## Challenge

Discover user scenarios that prove ML-driven infotainment solutions' value to vehicle OEMs and their customers.

## Approach

- **Contextual inquiries** — Observed drivers' interactions with infotainment systems throughout their day
- **Quantitative baseline** — Measured time and taps needed to complete common interface tasks

We discovered key insights:

- **A few tasks lead to most touches** — Adjusting radios and making calls accounted for the vast majority
- **Infrequently used hardware** — Garage door openers were often touched twice or never
- **Repetitive tasks took the same effort each time** — Calling home when leaving work always took the same number of taps despite being predictable
- **Glances add up** — Nearly all taps required looking away from the road (1.15–1.32 seconds average)

Based on findings, we developed a new interface with "smart buttons"—action buttons the system learned you performed regularly based on location, time, and route. We tested from low-fidelity wireframes through an iPad mounted in an F-150 on a closed test track.

## Results

- **Reduced driver distraction by 3 seconds average** for each prioritized task
- **Reduced taps by 3 on average** for each prioritized task
- **Reduced costs** by removing infrequently used hardware like garage door buttons
- Demonstrated polished interface to Ford leadership on a test bench
- **Bosch and Ford entered a project partnership** to further develop the ML Radio for future Ford vehicles
