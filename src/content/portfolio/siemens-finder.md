Led the design and implementation of an AI-powered content recommendation system that dramatically improved how B2B customers discover solutions across Siemens' complex product portfolio.

## Situation

Siemens Digital Industries Software provides B2B software and services across industry domains. Our website contained a wealth of valuable content, but customers struggled to find what was relevant to their needs and stage in their journey.

Early in their journey, customers are still creating mental models to understand their own challenges—making exceptional UX more difficult. The result was low content consumption, frustrating experiences, and lost opportunities to engage potential and current customers.

## Challenge

Improve content discoverability and personalize the customer journey, aligning disparate stakeholder perspectives into a unified vision while guiding users through a complex product ecosystem.

## Approach

- **Initiated and led workshops** to identify customer pain points related to content navigation
- **Developed the "Finder" concept** — a CMS component providing personalized content recommendations
- **Championed the "Mini Finder" strategy** — When the team became bogged down aligning every piece of content with every possible customer question, I refocused on a smaller, more manageable problem to validate the core concept quickly
- **Facilitated cross-functional alignment** through workshops with teams across Product, Analytics, and Marketing
- **Established success criteria** — Drove Product and Analytics teams to construct tiered measures to assess performance

## Results

Early results from user testing and A/B testing:

- **Reduced clicks to content from 77 to 4** for tasks like accessing "Intro to Mechanical Design"
- **50% of users who interact with Finder** arrive at a results page with deeper-funnel content
- **~20% of that group converts** to trials and purchase leads
- Improved customer journey with smoother, more intuitive guidance toward relevant solutions
- Foundation established for scaling across sites with deep taxonomy integration and AI-driven question generation
