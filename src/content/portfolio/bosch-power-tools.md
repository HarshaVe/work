Led field research that transformed Bosch Power Tools' North American strategy, revealing the roots of stubborn brand loyalty and unlocking new revenue streams.

## Situation

Bosch Power Tools struggled to get beyond single-digit market share in North America. They had tried everything—buying retail space in big box stores, NASCAR ads—but the market proved loyal to competitors to an intimidating degree.

After nearly a decade of trying, they turned to us to determine how they could make headway.

## Challenge

Identify a way for Bosch to increase its market share in an extremely brand-loyal market.

## Approach

I knew I needed to broaden the scope. Bosch had intelligent marketers and strategists who knew the brand better than I could—they hadn't left obvious ideas on the table.

After convincing the President of Power Tools through a half-day workshop using exercises like the IDEO Wallet exercise, we launched a comprehensive research effort:

- **Separated customers into Users and Buyers** — Identical for consumers, but large construction organizations differentiate these roles
- **Field studies** — Sent researcher pairs to construction sites in Chicago, Detroit, and Atlanta
- **Cross-functional analysis** — Analyzed results with researchers, Power Tool marketers, and my research team
- **Customer journey maps** — Created robust maps for both Users and Buyers

## Results

We uncovered the roots of brand preference:

**Users** were introduced to brands by mentors or trade schools. They didn't just have preferences—they *identified* as "DeWalt" or "Milwaukee" people.

**Buyers** cared about efficiency. Two hours spent looking for an adapter meant lost wages, missed inspections, and deadlines. Their focus was ensuring materials were at the correct job site.

Based on findings, we launched North America–specific initiatives:

- **Scaled back retail spending** — In-store ads would never disrupt established loyalties
- **Trade school focus** — Sponsored skills competitions to grow with users early
- **Asset management solution** — Developed IoT platform allowing buyers to track tools and accessories, which evolved into a white-label solution working with other brands

While Bosch is still making inroads, seeds of growth have been planted with users, and leadership recognizes revenue potential beyond tool sales.
