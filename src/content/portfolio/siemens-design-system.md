Led the unification and modernization of Siemens' design systems across platforms and teams, transforming fragmented ecosystems into a cohesive, scalable design foundation supporting the "One Siemens" initiative.

## Situation

When Siemens combined its US (SW) and European (AG) digital teams into a single XD organization, we inherited three fundamentally different ecosystems:

- Two design languages and token sets
- Three CMS platforms (Webiny, Contentful, and AEM)
- Three front-end component libraries
- Different documentation and onboarding paths
- No unified governance or contribution model

The impact was visible at every level: customers experienced inconsistent UI and interaction patterns, content editors struggled with duplicated components and unclear rules, developers rebuilt similar components with little reuse, and brand consistency was difficult to manage at scale.

## Challenge

Lead the unification across platforms and teams by establishing a shared design system, aligning component sets toward a common standard, improving the authoring experience for hundreds of global content editors, and creating governance processes that could scale—all while supporting Siemens' broader objectives around brand consistency, operational efficiency, and digital revenue growth.

## Approach

**Created a shared fact base through joint audit**
Aligned SW and AG teams on a single view of reality by auditing foundational styles, cataloguing components across both stacks, mapping CMS content model differences, and bringing cross-functional groups together to synthesize findings collaboratively.

**Established a unified, token-driven foundation**
Defined a shared primitive color palette and semantic token set, standardized typography and spacing scales, introduced themeable tokens with accessibility baked in, and implemented token syncing between Figma and the Siemens Shared Library.

**Aligned high-impact components across platforms**
Harmonized heroes, carousels, cards, highlight sections, and block-level components. Evaluated each change against brand direction, product UI, research insights, and development feasibility—designing toward a strategic middle ground rather than copying one system into another.

**Defined the Core Design System architecture**
Worked with leads from design, engineering, product, content strategy, and operations to define: a Core Figma library, a shared front-end component layer, aligned CMS component models, consolidated documentation in ZeroHeight, and a governance model describing ownership and contribution paths.

**Improved the content-authoring experience**
Standardized content modals, simplified configuration options, created consistent naming conventions, defined clear nesting rules, improved theme selection including dark mode, and updated documentation to help editors build high-quality pages.

**Embedded governance and lifecycle processes**
Defined workflows for proposing, reviewing, and deploying changes. Clarified roles across design, development, and content. Connected analytics to monitor usage and performance. Built QA expectations for UX, content, and accessibility.

## Results

**Experience Quality**
- Coherent Siemens design language across core digital properties
- Consistent patterns for color, typography, spacing, and interaction across SW and AG
- Accessibility and semantic structure embedded from the start

**Operational Efficiency**
- Reduced design and development effort through tokenized, reusable components
- Higher component reuse across Contentful and AEM instead of parallel one-off solutions
- Faster onboarding for designers, developers, and content editors

**Governance & Scale**
- Unified documentation and Figma libraries as single source of truth
- Defined governance and contribution processes that allow evolution without fragmentation
- Scalable architecture supporting additional platforms over time

**Strategic Impact**
- Advanced "One Siemens" initiative by aligning multiple regions, platforms, and teams
- Supported Frictionless CX goals with more consistent, predictable digital experiences
- Created strategic design foundation supporting digital revenue and marketplace ambitions
