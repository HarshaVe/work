Led the evolution of Siemens' enterprise design system, unifying multiple legacy systems into a cohesive framework serving 3,000+ internal creators and hundreds of agency partners.

- Built governance framework balancing consistency with flexibility
- Established contribution model for federated teams

## Impact

- 80%+ adoption across target properties
- Reduced design-to-development handoff time by 30%
- Enabled accessibility compliance at scale
