Led the redesign of GM's fragmented mobile app ecosystem into a unified platform serving millions of vehicle owners across seven global brands.

## Situation

In 2016, General Motors spent millions yearly on a collection of limiting and fractured mobile apps. Despite significant resources, the apps failed to serve owner needs or drive engagement. The apps' failure limited brand relevance to in-vehicle interactions, and with vehicle sales volumes shrinking, GM needed additional revenue streams from existing owners.

I was hired to manage teams responsible for user research, information architecture, UX design, visual design, service design, and copywriting across mobile apps, desktop sites, and the emerging in-vehicle presence of Apple CarPlay and Android Auto.

## Challenge

Create a singular app (code-named Omnibus) that would:

- Expand connected vehicle services (OnStar) globally
- Provide a platform for new service-driven revenue streams
- Reduce production costs
- Stop owners from deleting the app after a single use

## Approach

Through qualitative interviews and in-app analytics, we determined the app needed to:

- **Increase owners' awareness of needs** — Ensure they could always recognize when their vehicle required attention
- **Reduce errors** — Reflect diverse needs and vehicle capabilities without adding complexity
- **Reduce cognitive load** — Avoid barraging owners with features at the cost of core functionality

We spent weeks in a focus room to document every pixel of existing UI, find divergent and common patterns from the owners' perspective, and harmonize those needs into a cohesive design system.

The pattern-driven design enabled owners to utilize new features (EV vehicles, parking functionality) while not losing track of essentials like flat tires and oil changes—and allowed development teams to move faster by extending existing patterns rather than building from scratch.

## Results

- **7 branded apps** launched across dozens of countries supporting **23 languages**
- Owners recognized items needing attention at **4x the prior rate**
- In-app analytics showed increased exploration of service revenue features
- Reduced production costs through pattern-driven development
- Years later, the apps maintain a **4.9/5 rating** on the Apple Store with 378K+ ratings
