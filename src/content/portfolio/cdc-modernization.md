Led the redesign of CDC's mobile HIV testing locator, dramatically increasing conversions and reaching underserved populations during implementation of the White House's National HIV/AIDS Strategy.

## Situation

As Analytics & User Experience Manager for the CDC's National Center for HIV/AIDS, Viral Hepatitis, STD and TB Prevention (NCHHSTP), I led a mixed badge team responsible for web metrics and user experience across 18+ websites and tools generating 70+ million page views annually.

In 2010, the White House released a comprehensive National HIV/AIDS Strategy targeting lower-income, minority populations increasingly affected by the disease. Our research showed these users were gaining internet access primarily through mobile devices, yet our existing mobile site (m.hivtest.org) had marginal traffic and only 11% conversion rates.

## Challenge

We needed to dramatically increase both traffic and conversion—getting more at-risk users from the site to actual testing centers.

## Approach

Our user research and testing revealed three key barriers:

- **Coded language**: The site used terms like "CVBL" and "GONR"—familiar to public health professionals but meaningless to users
- **Unaddressed fears**: HIV and AIDS carry significant stigma; the site did nothing to ease first-time visitors' trepidation
- **Device fragmentation**: Our target users accessed the site across dozens of device resolutions, platforms, and browsers

Our design recommendations:

- Implement responsive web design to bridge platform and resolution disparities
- Rewrite all content in plain language
- Add new content addressing user concerns about the disease and testing process

## Results

After testing and iteration, we launched the redesigned site in June 2012, coordinating with state agencies and advocacy groups.

- **Page views**: 1,988 → 58,835 (first month)
- **Unique visitors**: 1,195 → 17,995
- **Pages per visitor**: 1.7 → 3.3
- **Conversion rate**: +72% first month, +76% across 5-month average

The redesigned site reached more users, eased their concerns with better information, and successfully connected them to HIV testing and services.
